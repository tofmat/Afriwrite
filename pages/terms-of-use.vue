            <p align="justify" class="mt-3">
              The following terms of service or service agreement governs your use of the AfriWrites platform 
              (owned by the AdepT Multibusiness Global Ventures) and our service delivery to you. 
              This agreement is a contract between you (the person who seeks to use the AfriWrites platform 
              and its services) and AdepT Multibusiness Global Ventures (the company that owns Afriwrites.com, 
              fully registered in Nigeria - BN 2942845). <br/><br/>
              You must agree to these terms of use before you can use the AfriWrites platform or benefit from 
              any of its services. Please, if you can’t agree to these terms, do not use this platform and its 
              services. <br/><br/>

              </ul>

            <h2>How AfriWrites Works</h2>
            <p align="justify">
              <ol type="1">
                <li>
                  The client will register and verify their identity. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  After registration, the client will post jobs, choosing one of our recognized and highly-regulated writing niches. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Clients must provide personal instructions or choose from our pre-approved niche instructions. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Freelancers will submit proposals and clients will reach out to any of them. Both freelancer and 
                  client will discuss and agree on a set of instructions and delivery time before signing a contract.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once the contract is made and accepted by the freelancer, the freelancer will start working on the 
                  project and the client can ask about progress at any time. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Freelancer needs to complete the job and send it to the client for approval on or before the 
                  delivery date.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After checking the content delivered, the client will approve payment or ask the freelancer to make 
                  corrections. The client can ask the freelancer for corrections as many times as they like. 
                  Nonetheless, the client needs to give the freelancer at least one more opportunity (after the first 
                  content submitted by freelancer) to make amends before using the <i class="text-danger">Disputes Resolution feature</i> 
                  available to them within the project’s menus. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the client is not satisfied with the corrections made by the freelancer, they can use the 
                  <i class="text-danger">Disputes Resolution feature</i> to alert the freelancer that the project might not end well. The 
                  Freelancer might also be the first to use the <i class="text-danger">Disputes Resolution feature</i>. The Disputes Resolution 
                  feature is aimed at ensuring that both freelancer and client are able to talk and resolve issues 
                  understandably without contacting us and with no repercussions on their reputations on the 
                  AfriWrites platform. Once one of the two parties start the Disputes Resolution process, the other 
                  party can not start it again (the only thing the other party can do is to respond to what the first 
                  party had demanded within the already activated Disputes Resolution process). No matter who starts 
                  the process, here are options available to both client and freelancer in the Disputes Resolution 
                  feature:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>Extend the delivery time:</b> the freelancer can request delivery extension (with specific 
                      reasons and new delivery date). The client has two days to agree or decline the demand, otherwise 
                      the freelancer‘s request will be automatically accepted. On the other hand, the client can accept, 
                      decline, or suggest another delivery date with reasons. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Demand for the contract to be canceled:</b> the freelancer or client can demand contract cancellation, 
                      stating reasons for such a demand. If the request is from the freelancer, the client has to accept 
                      or decline the demand (with specific reasons) before 48 hours. If there’s no response, the contract 
                      is automatically canceled. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Demand for contract modification:</b> the client or freelancer can demand for specific modifications 
                      to the contract, stating specific reasons. You can modify the price, delivery date, and deliverables. 
                      The other party has the obligation to accept or decline your request, stating reasons. There must be a 
                      response within 48 hours, otherwise the modification request will be automatically accepted. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Request contract update:</b> the client can demand for project updates from the freelancer. This is 
                      to force the freelancer to talk. If the freelancer fails to update the client within 48 hours, the project 
                      will be automatically canceled. 
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the <i class="text-danger">Disputes Resolution feature</i> has failed to resolve an issue, the client or freelancer can escalate the 
                  situation by reporting the issue to the AfriWrites' <i class="text-danger">Problem Resolution Team</i>. If you’re doing this, you have to 
                  bring all necessary evidence that the other party has done wrong. Usually, cases that get to our 
                  <i class="text-danger">Problem Resolution Team</i> ends up being canceled; so here are reasons we might cancel a contract:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      When the freelancer is late for project’s delivery and remains unresponsive to the client for 24 hours after the deadline.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When either the freelancer or client uses abusive words, abusive behaviors, or threats towards the other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When either the freelancer or client becomes inactive due to violations of AfriWrites Terms of Use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When the freelancer constantly demands for deadline extensions without delivering the final content. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When the buyer constantly demands revisions to get more or other services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When the content delivered does not meet the instructions contained in the contract agreement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When the freelancer or client is using illegal methods to circumvent any of the instructions in 
                      these terms of use or measures taken by the platform to protect the integrity of the platform
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When any of the users is going against the contract terms.  
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unless otherwise agreed by both freelancer and client, the client reserves the sole rights to the 
                  intellectual property already paid for to the freelancer. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Revisions can be requested based on mutual agreement between the freelancer and client, and there 
                  might be no revisions at all. Clients must not request for additional services that are not part of 
                  the initial agreement by requesting for revisions. Moreover, freelancers must not offer their services 
                  for free on the AfriWrites platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When there is a dispute or cancellation, AfriWrites reserves the right to play an impartial middleman 
                  between the client and freelancer and help both parties reach reasonable agreement. The decision of 
                  AfriWrites is final in cases of disputes. Our <i class="text-danger">Problem Resolution Team</i> will assess all disputes and 
                  contract cancellations to reach reasonable conclusions.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
              <b>NOTE:</b> We don’t cancel contracts for quality reasons. That’s why we’ve tested and coached all 
              freelancers before they could offer their services on this platform. We also ensure freelancers are 
              up-to-date on best practices in the content writing industry, and test their knowledge frequently. 
              On our part, we’ve ensured that each sample article on the freelancer’s profile is a good (not perfect) 
              representation of the writing-quality-level of the freelancer. Your responsibility is to dig deep into 
              the abilities of the freelancer to know their strengths. Therefore, we advise that you check these samples. 
              Depending on your experience with each freelancer, we encourage you to leave feedback at the end of each 
              project to let other clients know the quality of service offered by the freelancer.

            <h2>Payments on the AfriWrites Platform</h2>
            <p align="justify">
              <ol type="1">
                <li>
                  As a writer on the AfriWrites platform, by agreeing to these terms of use, you agree that AfriWrites 
                  (through AdepT Multibusiness Global Ventures) is your authorized payment collection agent for the 
                  purpose of accepting payments from clients on the AfriWrites platform. As a client on the AfriWrites 
                  platform, by agreeing to this terms of use, you agree that AfriWrites (through AdepT Multibusiness 
                  Global Ventures) is your payment agent for the purpose of paying writers on the AfriWrites platform. 
                  Therefore, AfriWrites is responsible for remitting payments to the freelance writer whenever the 
                  freelance writer completes a project successfully on the AfriWrites platform. AfriWrites, through 
                  AdepT Multibusiness Global Ventures and PayStack, will play the middleman between the client and 
                  freelance writer on the platform. AfriWrites will hold the money paid for each project by the client 
                  until the project is completed satisfactorily by the freelancer when the money will be released to the 
                  freelancer. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  For now, the only Payment Provider used by the platform is PayStack and freelancers can receive 
                  payments from the platform through any of the methods acceptable by PayStack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Clients pay AfriWrites in advance to enter into a contractual agreement with a freelance writer on 
                  the platform. However, some vetted clients may be able to take advantage of our <i class="text-danger">PayLater features</i>, 
                  in which a client doesn’t need to pay in advance at the point of contract creation. With the PayLater 
                  feature, the client must contact the AfriWrites <i class="text-danger">Customer Support Team</i> for vetting before access is given. 
                  If you’re able to use the <i class="text-danger">PayLater feature</i>, it means the AfriWrites platform is standing as a guarantor 
                  for the client. This feature requires a strict vetting process, and the feature can only be activated 
                  manually. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Freelance writers and clients are responsible for paying taxes themselves, which may vary from 
                  jurisdiction to jurisdiction. By agreeing to these terms of use, users agree that they are to 
                  use their discretions in following the tax laws in their jurisdictions. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Again, you cannot cancel a contract based on the quality delivered by the freelancer if the content 
                  delivered is exactly as it was requested in the freelancer agreement (if the freelancer followed all 
                  the instructions adopted while signing the contract). However, you can leave a good/bad rating and 
                  comment on the freelancer’s skills after the project has been completed. It is best you check the 
                  sample articles on the freelancer’s profile to assess their writing skills before hiring. Moreover, 
                  check and recheck the instructions you’re adopting before hiring.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contact the AfriWrites <i class="text-danger">Problems Resolution Team</i> only after you’ve complained to the freelancer about 
                  what they’ve done wrong, allowed them to make revisions, and used the <i class="text-danger">Disputes Resolution</i> feature. 
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
