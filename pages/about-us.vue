            <p class="mt-3" align="justify">
              Hi, I am <b>Tayo Adepetu</b> – a Copywriter and Full-service Digital Marketer. <br/><br/>
              I’m a lover of quality writing who believes the interests of the readers are supreme. 
              This means your website content must give them all useful information that they need 
              to make the best decision. Being a freelance writer and having worked with several 
              content writers, I’ve observed that a lot of writers only run for the cash, neglecting 
              the interests of their readers. This is unacceptable to me. <br/><br/>If we allow bad writers to 
              continue dumping bad content on the web, then the web will lose its integrity in no time. 
              Indeed, the Google algorithm is clamping down on bad content, but humans have proven to 
              know how to circumvent robots efficiently. Therefore, I believe some people need to take 
              responsibility (within their limited sphere of influence) in ensuring only the best content 
              gets published. <br/><br/>As an African freelance writer, I’ve observed how my counterparts from the 
              same continent suffer discrimination due to the unproven believe that we cannot write as good 
              as the whites. I’ve worked with some poor native speakers and I’ve also worked with excellent 
              African writers. I believe it is the same with many writers in every continent. Indeed, there 
              could be little differences here and there, but there are only two types of writers: good writers 
              and bad writers. This is independent of geography, and it doesn’t matter whether you were born a 
              native speaker or not.
            </p>

            <h2>The Birth of CopyAfrica in 2020</h2>
            <p align="justify">
              After freelancing for three years, I created an agency – CopyAfrica – with the hope of scaling my 
              freelance writing career. Later on, as the Covid-19 locked down everywhere in 2020, I discovered 
              that more and more African freelance writers depended on me to get writing jobs and earn their 
              daily bread. At first, I taught many of them how to write excellently and employed those who 
              proved to grasp my teachings. Those I couldn’t employ, I referred to some friends (local and foreign) 
              who might need their services. However, I discovered that there are many African writers out there who 
              needed the same opportunity, and I couldn’t help everyone. 
            </p>

            <h2>The Birth of AfriWrites</h2> 
            <p align="justify">
              In early 2021, my love for quality content, hatred for the discrimination against Africans on popular 
              freelance marketplaces, and the need for African writers to get a platform where they can build their 
              freelancing careers gave me the idea of AfriWrites. Indeed, I knew building something so enormous 
              requires a lot of resources and the support of a good planning and implementation team, but I moved 
              forward in faith. 
            </p>

            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <p align="justify">
              <ol type="1">
                <li>
                  To offer solutions to all problems facing African freelance writers. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  To teach more Africans how to write quality content that meets global standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To help lift more Africans out of poverty by extending more opportunities to them in the freelancing space. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  To let the world know that Africans write well and offer value. 
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
          
            <h2>The Mission </h2>
            <p align="justify">
              <ol type="1">
                <li>
                  To provide secure payment systems for African Freelance Writers. I’ve noticed that African Freelance Writers 
                  lose money because of the limited payment methods available to them. We want the AfriWrites platform to serve 
                  as a bridge where both Freelancers and their foreign and local clients can trust and feel secure that their 
                  interests are being prioritized. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  To create a platform where African Freelance Writers can bring their local and foreign clients to sign writing 
                  contracts and execute writing projects, without discrimination of any sort. The platform will be filled with 
                  only Trained, Tested Elite African Freelance Writers, just to ensure the clients (both foreign and local) 
                  bringing jobs trust the platform and find it helpful. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  To create a freelance writing platform where the website admins do their best in ensuring the creation of quality
                   content for all clients. As an African freelance writer, I’ve realized that African Writers always have to put 
                   more effort (more than their foreign counterparts) in their jobs to gain recognition. Therefore, the writers 
                   on this platform must ensure only quality content is given to clients. No matter the project, each client 
                   must be satisfied. 
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
